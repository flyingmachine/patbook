  %h1 How Ruby Magic?
  
  %p Everyone knows that Ruby is a powerful language. Its dynamic nature allows you to concisely write the code you need to actually solve a problem instead of burying yourself mountains of boilerplate. You don't have to fight it; you just get to enjoy the ride.

  %p But where does the magic come from? And can you trust it? After all, MRI is written in C - a statically typed, compiled language which is pretty much the antithesis of Ruby. What dark voodoo is breathed into C to enable Ruby's features - closures, metaprogramming, and so much more?
  
  %h2 Find out with Science!

  %p <strong>Ruby Under a Microscope</strong> will guide you through the internals of some of Ruby's most powerful features. Using a combination of experimentation and theory, you'll see clearly how Ruby is implemented.

  %p You'll transform from a caveman, pointing at closures and grunting "Scope uh... blocks, stuff" to lucidly explaining how Ruby copies variables from the stack to the heap in order to allow access to them even after a function has returned.

  %p Have no clue what that means? Well, that's exactly why you need to read this book.

  %h2 People Already Love It and It Doesn't Even Fully Exist

    Normally anything that starts with "internals" is boring to read, but Pat Shaughnessy made the Ruby hash interesting.

    You have done an excellent job taking the internals and making them exciting and digestible. I really look forward to the full book.
